## About This Repo

My first foray into data structures and algorithms so I'll use this repo to track my progress as I'm learning and working through coding problems.

I'm currently following [LeetCode's Interview Crash Course: Data Structures and Algorithms](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/), which provides a structured path for learning fundamental concepts and problem-solving patterns.

/**
 * Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
 *
 * You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order.
 * It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:
 *
 * [3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
 * [1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
 *
 * Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of the array to the beginning.
 * Rotating the array 6 times produces the original array.
 *
 * Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array nums are unique, return the minimum element of this array.
 *
 * A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 1:
 * // Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2]
 * // Output: 1
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 2:
 * // Input: nums = [4,5,0,1,2,3]
 * // Output: 0
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 3:
 * // Input: nums = [4,5,6,7]
 * // Output: 4
 *
 * @constraints
 * - 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * - -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 *
